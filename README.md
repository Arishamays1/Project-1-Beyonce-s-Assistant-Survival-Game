# Project-1-Beyonce's-Asistant-Survival-Game.
This game is heavily inspired bythe viral Twitter thread created by the twitter handle, @Cornyasbitch. The Beyonce's Assistant Survival Game is a choose-your-own-path style game in which your decisions as Beyonce's assistant impacts the rest of the game potentially. Some options for the multple scenarios lead to instant game over, while others add to her attributes bar and continue her story. I plan on implementing background 8 bit beyonce music in the background as well.

I wanted to make the game look more alive. Since the model was a still frame of Beyonce, I decided to go a step further and animate an 8bit version based off of the still picture. To do this, I drew the edited animations myself on Procreate on my iPad then created a gif of each one.
Here are my sprites.


Happy Beyonce

ICEBOX PLANS (Next Steps)
- In the future, I would love to make the game longer in which the Beyonce can brng other characters into the game itself and interact with another character/celebrity. 
- I would like to develop even more gifs and models for the game in order to show the reactions to different scenarios. The model should interact with the environment
- Have buzzer music play when the wrong option is picked
